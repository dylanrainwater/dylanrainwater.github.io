        	<h2>Contrary to popular belief, math is beautiful</h2>
        	<p>
        		Math can express great meaning and fascinating imagery. Surely
                that means that math meets the qualifications of something that
                is beautiful, right?
        	</p>

            <h2>Math, like poetry, can express beautiful imagery</h2>
        	<p>
                Obviously beauty is subjective, however there are some things
                that we can almost all agree are beautiful in one way or another,
                such as a young child's laugh, or a truly moving piece of poetry.
                Another thing that we ought to add to such a list is math.
                Don't just believe me though, take a look for yourself.
        	</p>

            <p>
                That's a fractal, or more specifically, the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set">Mandelbrot set</a>.
                A fractal is a term in math that means, simply, something with
                properties that repeat forever. The Mandelbrot set, named after
                Benoit Mandelbrot, actually has some very
                <i>complex</i> math behind it, and when we use computers to visualize
                said math, it takes the form of the beautiful image above.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is all very similar to poetry, believe it or not. In your middle
                school English class, you probably learned about something called
                "imagery." Imagery is a very powerful tool that allows poets to use
                the English language to craft beautiful visuals from words that magically
                appear in a readers' head. As Ron Aharoni says in
                <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Mathematics_Poetry_and_Beauty.html?id=3XygoAEACAAJ">
                <i>Mathematics, Poetry, and Beauty</i></a>,
                "mathematicians too, think in pictures," which allows them to
                create beautiful formulas that form things like the Mandelbrot
                set and more.
            </p>

            <h2>Great ideas are expressed in mathematics</h2>
            <p>
                While the visuals are truly spectacular, there's more to math
                than just that. I don't think that many of us have fond memories
                of trigonometry in high school. Most of us probably remember
                painstakingly learning that sine and cosine do ... something? With
                a circle? And some triangles? This is probably due to how trig
                is taught in schools, instead of being taught to recognize the
                beauty of what the famous trig functions do, we were taught to
                be afraid of the difficulty of memorizing tons of seemingly
                random and pointless identities. As Paul Lockhart puts it in
                <a href="http://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf"><i>A Mathematician's Lament</i></a>,
                "our present system of mathematics education is ... a mechanism
                for  the  express  purpose of destroying a child’s natural
                curiosity and love of pattern-marking."
            </p>

            <img style="display:block;margin:auto;" src="http://i.imgur.com/cBzeLOo.gif"/>

            <p>
                In reality, trig functions actually carry great meaning. Without
                sine and cosine, bridges wouldn't be nearly as stable, buildings
                would rarely be more than simple cubes, and, possibly worst of all,
                most video games we know and love today wouldn't be possible.
                They are very beautifully defined functions that allow mathematicians
                and engineers to manipulate the real world in a truly unique way.
                All because, essentially, sine and cosine are the height and width of
                a triangle, respectively. Obviously math can get really complicated,
                but the fundamentals that we so often skip over and take for granted
                are arguably the most important and satisfying things to learn in math.
                These should be the things that teachers are incentivized
                to teach young students in order to create or uncover a passion
                for math in each of us.
            </p>

            <p>
                Math can also carry complex ideas within itself and even make
                leaps between theoretical ideas, showing how beautiful and
                intertwined math can be. One particular identity that does just
                this is called Euler's identity, named after the great mathematician
                Leonhard Euler. Euler's identity, as
                <a href="http://www.science4all.org/article/eulers-identity/">science4all</a>
                says, is how Euler "merged the most amazing numbers of mathematics"
                into one expression: e<sup>iπ</sup> + 1 = 0. This is considered
                beautiful because it manages to combine Euler's number, e, commonly
                found in economics and engineering, i, the imaginary number that
                is used in several advanced areas of math, π, the famous irrational
                and transcendental number that is the circumference of the unit
                circle, 1, the multiplicative identity, and 0
                the additive identity. All of these numbers are independently
                useful and interesting, and the fact that there is a way to
                relate them all is truly beautiful.
            </p>

            <h2>"But there's no interpretation!"</h2>
            <h3><i>Actually there is!</i></h3>

            <p>
                In fact, math can even be controversial. Bet you never
                considered that, huh? About a hundred years ago, a fantastic
                self-taught mathematician named Srinivasa Ramanujan declared
                that 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ... = -1/12. Or in other words, if you add
                every positive whole number, it equals a negative fraction. That's
                not intuitive at all, and many people don't believe it, including
                mathematicians, but as the nature of controversial topics tends to
                go, there are also many mathematicians that do believe it. A
                content creator on YouTube named
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1_uAIS3r8Vu6JjXWvastJg">Mathologer</a>
                has a great video on this famous statement and the
                controversiality of it, that you should definitely check out.
            </p>

            <p>
                Every math enthusiast, including myself and hopefully you, now,
                who has encountered this problem has a different opinion on
                whether or not it's true. This alone is enough to say that math
                can definitely be controversial and interpretive, adding to the
                reasons that math is a beautiful thing.
            </p>

            <h2>Are other things also more beautiful than they seem?</h2>
            <p>
                This is a great opportunity for you to go out and explore. The
                doors are open for you to go out and challenge any of your
                previous thoughts and opinions on everything, and see if you truly
                hate the things you think you hate, or if you just think you do.
                Is math really <i>that</i> bad? Is biology really your least
                favorite subject, or did you just have a bad biology teacher?
                That's for you to decide.
