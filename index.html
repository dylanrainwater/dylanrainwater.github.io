           <h2>Hey!</h2>
           <p>
                I'm Dylan! Thanks for checking out my website. I am very interested
                in software development and research. I am hoping to continue to graduate
                school and earn my doctorare in computer science after I graduate from
                the University of Tennessee.
                <br>You can look at
                the first post <a href="beauty_in_numbers.html">here</a>.
                I wrote that post as an assignment for my English 101
                class my first semester of university.
                Also, all of the header pictures accross the site
                are from  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.unsplash.com">unsplash</a>,
                check it out! They are awesome.

           <h2>My academic history</h2>
           <h3>University of Tennessee, Knoxville</h3>
           <p style="width: 60%;">
             <i>August 2016 - Present</i> <br/>
             Here I study computer science. I am interested in many fields of
             computer science including machine learning, data analytics, systems programming,
             robotics, game programming, cryptography, and others. I currently have a 3.60 GPA.
           </p>
           <h3>Governor's School for Computational Physics</h3>
           <p style="width: 60%;">
             <i>May, 2015</i> <br/>
             Here I studied Computer Science, Calculus, and Physics at Austin Peay State University. As
             a class we studied various physical phenomena using computer simulations
             that we wrote using FORTRAN.
           </p>
           <h3>East Ridge High School</h3>
           <p style="width: 60%;">
             <i>August 2012 - May 2016</i> <br/>
             I graduated 3rd in my class with a 4.0 GPA.
